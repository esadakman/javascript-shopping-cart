# Shopping Cart

## Objective

- Project aims to create a real checkout page of e-commerce website.

## Description

- My  goal was to develop a real e-commerce website's checkout page for that project. There is a cart for buying products, and we can increase or decrease the number of products. By changing a parameter in the cart, our js functions calculate the cart total price. DOM, iterator, callback functions, string-array functions and events are used in our page. Additionally, we can remove products from the cart by clicking the remove button and decreasing the amount to "0". In that case, our page asks us to delete the product from the cart. As soon as you confirm the deletion, the sour chart total is recalculated by the js functions. 

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this project, students will be able to;

- analyze a problem, create e-commerce website page.

- demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles for dynamic calculation of product's cart.

-  User story;

   - When I click plus button on product's row, I can increase the product's quantity.
   - When I click minus button on product's row, I can decrease the product's quantity, but minimum quantity value can be 1.
   - When I click remove button on product's row, I can delete a product in the cart.
   - When I change any combination of product chart(plus, minus, remove etc.), I want to see the new calculation of chart's prices in concerned fields.
